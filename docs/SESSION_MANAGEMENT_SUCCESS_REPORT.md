## 🧪 TESTING AND VALIDATION

### **Live System Tests Performed:**

✅ **Authentication Test**: User registration and login successful  
✅ **Database Connectivity**: All session tables accessible  
✅ **Session Creation**: Test session created successfully  
✅ **Activity Logging**: Session activities properly recorded  
✅ **Security Integration**: User authentication working  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All test endpoints responding correctly

### **Test Results:**

```json
{
  "message": "Session Management System is working!",
  "user_id": 8,
  "user_name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "active_sessions": 1,
  "total_activities": 1,
  "security_alerts": 0,
  "system_status": "✅ All session tables accessible",
  "features": [
    "User session tracking",
    "Device management",
    "Activity logging",
    "Security monitoring",
    "Session timeout/renewal",
    "Concurrent session limits"
  ]
}
```
