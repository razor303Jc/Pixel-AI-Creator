   - Database and Redis services
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **End-to-End Testing**

   - Playwright browser testing
   - Full application deployment
   - User journey validation

5. **Performance Testing**

### Environment Support

- **Staging**: Automated deployment from `develop` branch
- **Production**: Automated deployment from `main` branch
- **Manual**: Workflow dispatch for any environment

## Test Configuration (`conftest.py`)

### Core Features

- **Authentication Helper**: Simplified user auth for tests
- **Performance Timer**: Response time validation
- **Cleanup Automation**: Environment cleanup after tests

### Test Markers

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.e2e`: End-to-end tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance`: Performance tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow`: Long-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.redis`: Redis-dependent tests

## Quality Metrics & Coverage

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Backend API**: 95%+ code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for auth, payments, data integrity
- **Integration**: 90%+ workflow coverage
- **E2E**: 80%+ user journey coverage

### Performance Benchmarks

- **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95th percentile
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for simple operations
- **Page Load Time**: <3 seconds for dashboard
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ simultaneous users

### Code Quality Standards

- **Linting**: Zero Flake8 violations
- **Type Safety**: MyPy compliance
- **Security**: Zero high/critical Bandit findings
- **Dependencies**: Up-to-date, vulnerability-free packages

## Test Execution Commands

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/test_comprehensive_endpoints.py -v

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/test_integration_workflows.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run performance tests
locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000

# Run Playwright tests
pytest tests/test_e2e_playwright.py --browser=chromium
```

### CI/CD Execution

- Automatic execution on push/PR to `main` or `develop`
- Manual workflow dispatch for specific environments
- Parallel execution across test categories
- Artifact collection and reporting

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Test Reports

- **HTML Coverage Reports**: Detailed line-by-line coverage
- **JUnit XML**: CI/CD integration and history tracking
- **Playwright Reports**: Browser test results with screenshots
- **Performance Reports**: Load testing metrics and graphs

### Quality Gates

- **Build Failure**: Any test failure blocks deployment
- **Coverage Gate**: Minimum 90% coverage required
- **Performance Gate**: Response time thresholds enforced
- **Security Gate**: No high/critical vulnerabilities allowed
