## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **ChromaDB Issues**: Have backup vector storage options (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **RazorFlow Integration**: Plan for manual template deployment if API fails
- **Performance Issues**: Implement caching early in development

### Timeline Risks

- **Resource Availability**: Cross-train team members on multiple components
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP feature set for initial release
- **External Dependencies**: Have backup plans for third-party integrations

### Quality Risks

- **Testing Delays**: Start testing early and run continuously
- **Security Issues**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing
- **Scalability**: Load testing before production deployment
