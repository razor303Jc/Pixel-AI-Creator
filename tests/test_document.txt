Test Document for File Upload System

This is a test document to validate the file upload system in the Pixel-AI-Creator platform.

Key features to test:
1. File upload through drag-and-drop interface
2. Document text extraction and processing
3. Vector embedding generation and storage
4. Document management (list, view, delete)

The system should be able to:
- Accept TXT, PDF, and DOCX files
- Extract text content from uploaded files
- Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
- Store document metadata in PostgreSQL
- Provide a user-friendly interface for document management

This test document contains enough text to validate the text extraction and processing pipeline.
